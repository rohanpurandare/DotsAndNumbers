    <h3>The objective of the game is to create a loop on the board such that each square has as many edges as the number inside the square.</h3>
    <h3>To create a line, simply click between the two dots you wish to create a line between. If you want to remove a line, simply click on the line you want to remove.</h3>
    <h3>When a square has the correct number of edges, it will turn green.</h3>
    <h3>If you realize you want to clear the board, simply press the "Clear Lines!" button, and the board will be cleared</h3>
    <h3>If you want to play a new game, press the "New Game!" button, otherwise, you will get a new game shortly after you finish</h3>
